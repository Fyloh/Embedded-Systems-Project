## Introduction
Escalade is a game that will be played on an LED Matrix. In Escalade, you are a single dot on the LED Matrix that needs to maneuver around walls of enemies that will descend from the top of the LED Matrix to the bottom. There will be a powerup that will allow you to shoot and break through the descending walls
